# uGW
subsampling_ums.m generates random ultrametric spaces and store the distance matrices in a file Us.mat
computing_slb.m computes the uGW-slb and dGW-slb for Us.mat and generates corresponding distance matrices sorted by number of blocks in ultrametric spaces.
visual.m computes uGW-slb and dGW-slb between any given pair (i,j) of spaces in Us.mat and generates the corresponding dendrograms and distance distributions.
